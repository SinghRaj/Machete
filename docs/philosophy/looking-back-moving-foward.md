# Looking Back, Moving Forward

If you think about it, most of the innovations around data processing has come in the form of databases. Think about all the Big Data solutions that have popped up in the last few years. Think about how relational database technology has fueled. Over the past few decades the push has been toward capturing data from all types of devices, exotic or otherwise. Now, its almost as if  humankind has finally awaken to the reality that the mechanisms it has built to store and process that data are no longer adequate. Although the theories behind these technologies have stood the test of time, there are other drivers that make some solutions untenable for companies. We are currently living in the most interesting time for computing. For the first time in human history we are now starting to look toward data to help inform our decisions, help us to be more efficient in our daily activities.

#### Don't reinvent the wheel

&lt;say something cool here&gt;

It would be nice if there was reference technology that works in similar way, I mean, who wants to reinvent the wheel anyway? Well, there actually is, just probably not what you might of had in mind. Ever heard of the relational database?

Believe it or not, but, there is quite a bit of relevant computer science in relational databases;

* Efficient storage data structures \(e.g. B-trees\)
* Efficient mechanisms and algorithms for data retrieval \(i.e. indexes\)
* Declarative language to retrieve and manipulate data \(i.e. Structured Query Language\)

I mean, the list goes on and on. Machete's genius is that it treats structured documents in much the same way relational databases treat structured data, that is, enabling queries to be executed against predefined schemas in the most efficient manner possible. That, and an awful lot of Functional Programming goodness sprinkled on top you get Machete.

Imagine a software package that runs on all major operating systems \(e.g. Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix\). Imagine an API that abstracts away the inherit complexities of dealing with complex data. Imagine a framework that allows you to define your own schema and run natively with the same core that the out-of-the-box schemas run within. Imagine having access to an extensible API core that provide services such as parsing, validation, translation, and formatting. Imagine having an API layer that is so pleasurable to use your developers enjoy coming to work everyday to solve the worlds problems.

The unfortunate reality is that most healthcare IT organizations don't operate like software shops.
